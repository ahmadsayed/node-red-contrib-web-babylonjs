# Hands on

Install node-red follow https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation

git clone https://github.com/ahmadsayed/node-red-contrib-web-babylonjs.git

cd node-red-contrib-web-babylonjs

npm link

Then start your node-red, the 3d section will show up and start using it

To access the 3D scene from 

```
http://127.0.0.1:1880/scene
```
# Windows user

```
